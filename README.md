# Word Game Discord Bot by Kobe Zheng

Built with Node.js <br/>
The Word Game Bot is the ideal Discord bot to add fun to a server. 
The bot allows members to engage by playing word games; it currently supports playing Hangman and Wordle.

# How the Discord Bot Works 
Server members can get more information about the available commands by tying **#help** <br />

The bot sends text messages into the server, giving the player instructions about how to play a word game. <br/>

When a game is started, the player can make guesses for the game they are playing. <br/>
Here is an example of a Wordle game <br/>
